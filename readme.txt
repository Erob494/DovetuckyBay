Game Name: Dovetucky Bay

Game Description:

	The main character in this game is named 'Bob'. As the player, you must help Bob pass three unique levels to restore the great, 
fallen city of Dovetucky Bay. This game will test the player on both their quick reactions and critical thinking while they are under pressure.

	Level 1:
		The player must collect seeds while avoiding obstacles such as a bolder and lava. The player must collect all of the seeds to bring back
to Dovetucky Bay safely so that trees can be planted for clean air and food.

	Level 2:
		The player must solve a picture puzzle to restore solar power to Dovetucky Bay. There are eight blocks within a nine block 
space so there is only one free space for the player to move one move at a time to rearrange all of the randomized blocks by sliding them
and rotating them. The player will have three minutes to solve the puzzle.

	Level 3:
		The player must solve a different puzzle that turns different pieces of pipes 90 degrees to create a complete, connected path and
restore water to Dovetucky Bay. The player will have two minutes to rearrange the pipes so that there is a complete, connected path.
